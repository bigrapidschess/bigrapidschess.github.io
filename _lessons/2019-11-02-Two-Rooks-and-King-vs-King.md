### Mating with two rooks
I would put some explanatory text here to set the stage for an interative chess exercises.
<div id="myGame01" style="padding-bottom:56.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">
<iframe id="embedGame01" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""
  style="position:absolute"; top:"0"; left: "0" src="//www.chess.com/emboard?id=6352908"></iframe>
</div>
I plan to add additional text after the exercise too. These documents will have several different interactive elements each.
