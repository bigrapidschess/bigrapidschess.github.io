### Mating with two rooks
I would put some explanatory text here to set the stage for an interative chess exercies.
<div class="responsiveGame">
<iframe allowTransparency="true" border="0" frameborder="0" src="//www.chess.com/emboard?id=6352908"></iframe>
</div>
I plan to add additional text after the exercise too. These documents will have several different interactive elements each.
