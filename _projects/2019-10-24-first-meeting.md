### Getting Started

Yesterday there were three boards active and we had several other interested people drop by. For the first session, I think that we had some pretty evenly matched games. Some preliminary results have been posted on our website on the [players page](https://bigrapidschess.com/players). Here are a few pictures of the action.

Due to scheduling conflicts at the library, we will not be able to meet for the next two weeks. Watch here and on our [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/club/big-rapids-chess) club page for more news. Hope to see even more people at our next meeting.
