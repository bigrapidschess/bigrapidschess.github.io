title: Chess Ladder
subtitle: One important part of our chess meetings is a chance to play competitive face-to-face games with each other. To add a little more interest, we have an ongoing chess ladder competition. The rules governing this activity are detailed below.

## The rules

1.	A lower number is a higher rank on the ladder, (better position). The goal of the competition is to move up the ladder, potentially to the number one position.

2.	A player (the challenger) may challenge another player with a higher rank (the defender) to play.

3.	The difference between the defender and challenger ranks must be no more than 4.
(for example: rank #5 can challenge #1, but #6 can only challenge up to #2)

4.	All challenges must be accepted unless the defender has already accepted a different challenge or are currently playing a game, or there is less than 20 minutes left to play in the session.

5.	Refusing a valid challenge is counted as a loss for the defender.

6.	Two players may not challenge each other in two consecutive games.

7.	Players that are absent for two consecutive sessions lose one position on the ladder.

8.	In a ladder challenge game, the defender always plays with the black pieces.

9.	If the defender wins the challenge game, there is no change in player positions.

10.	If the players draw (tie) the challenge game, the challenger moves up to the spot just below the defender. 
(for example, if #7 challenges #3 and draws, #3 stays at #3 and #7 moves up to #4. Positions 4, 5, and 6 would be bumped down in the process).

11.	All draws must be approved by the Ladder Game Supervisor.

12.	If the challenger wins, they take the defenderâ€™s position on the ladder. The defender (and those below them) are all bumped down one position on the ladder.
(for example, if #7 challenges #3 and wins, #3 is bumped to #4 and #7 becomes the new #3. Positions 4, 5, and 6 would be bumped down in the process).

13.	When a game is finished, the players must turn in a Ladder Challenge card to the Ladder Game Supervisor.

14.	New members are added to the bottom of the ladder.

15.	All disagreements and questions will be resolved by the Challenge Game Supervisor.
