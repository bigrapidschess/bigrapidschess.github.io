### The rules

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 1:**</span> A lower number is a higher rank on the ladder, (better position). The goal of the competition is to move up the ladder, potentially to the number one position.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 2:**</span> A player, the challenger, may challenge another player with a higher rank, the defender, to play.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 3:**</span> The difference between the defender and challenger ranks must be no more than 4. <br /> _For example: rank #5 can challenge #1, but #6 can only challenge up to #2)_

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 4:**</span> All challenges must be accepted unless the defender has already accepted a different challenge or are currently playing a game, or there is less than 20 minutes left to play in the session.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 5:**</span> Refusing a valid challenge is counted as a loss for the defender.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 6:**</span> Two players may not challenge each other in two consecutive games.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 7:**</span> Players that are absent for two consecutive sessions lose one position on the ladder.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 8:**</span> In a ladder challenge game, the defender always plays with the black pieces.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 9:**</span> If the defender wins the challenge game, there is no change in player positions.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 10:**</span> If the players draw (tie) the challenge game, the challenger moves up to the spot just below the defender.<br /> _For example, if #7 challenges #3 and draws, #3 stays at #3 and #7 moves up to #4. Positions 4, 5, and 6 would be bumped down in the process._

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 11:**</span> All draws must be approved by the Ladder Game Supervisor.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 12:**</span> If the challenger wins, they take the defenderâ€™s position on the ladder. The defender, and those below them, are bumped down one position on the ladder. <br /> _For example, if #7 challenges #3 and wins, #3 is bumped to #4 and #7 becomes the new #3. Positions 4, 5, and 6 would be bumped down in the process._

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 13:**</span> When a game is finished, the players must turn in a Ladder Challenge card to the Ladder Game Supervisor.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 14:**</span> New members are added to the bottom of the ladder.

<span style="color: black;">**Rule 15:**</span> All disagreements and questions will be resolved by the Challenge Game Supervisor.
