title: Chess Ladder
subtitle: This is the initial ladder of active club players following our first meeting at the library on October 24, 2019. We will keep track of the games played during club meetings here and update the scores on a weekly basis. We will not meet for a couple of weeks, though, due to scheduling conflicts at the library. See you at the next session.

### Current players
You can click on the table headings to sort the table information by column. An greater part of our meetings is involved in playing against each other for position on our player ladder.  We have created [a resource document](ladder.html) that explains how our chess ladder operates. A club Elo rating is also calculated and posted for each active player. [An explanation](rating.html) of how players scores are calculated is also available.
