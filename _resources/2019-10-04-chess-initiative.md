## Background

In 2016, several chess sets were donated to local businesses in the Big Rapids downtown. This effort was reported by the [Big Rapids Pioneer](https://www.bigrapidsnews.com/local-news/article/Initiative-distributes-chess-sets-across-Big-14137386.php) on February 19, 2016. The goal of this effort was to make chess more visible and available in the Big Rapids area. Club members are encouraged to patronize the participating locations and use the public chess sets. A list of our current locations includes:

* Big Rapids Community Library	
* Biggby Coffee
* Crankers  
* The Old Pioneer Store  
* Panera  
* Raven Pub and Brewery
* CLACS (Ferris University Center)	
* Quad Café	(Ferris University Center)
* Ferris Rock Café

We may try to place more sets around town in the future. Please use our contact form to let us know if you find that a set (or pieces of a particular set) are damaged or missing.
